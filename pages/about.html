        <p class="words">Arlyn grew up in California. Along the way she met a wonderful man who she eventually decided to marry. After
          their first child and some searching for work, they settled in Iowa. Together they blessed the world with four
          beautiful children. As a mom of four, naturally Arlyn keeps a camera handy for any moment that might be worth
          remembering. Once her kids got older and more generous she finally got the chance to step up her photo game
          with a "fancy" camera. While photography isn't her full time job, Arlyn enjoys capturing moments for anyone.

        <div class="words"><h1><span>Cancer Journey</span></h1>
        <p>Recently, Arlyn was diagnosed with breast cancer. It's been especially hard on her as she progresses through
          Chemotherapy. She has a strong support group of friends and family that have been by her side through it all,
          but it's still not something anyone should go through. Especially someone as kind and caring as Arlyn. Support her on <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/arlyns-cancer-journey?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link_all&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet">GoFundMe</a></p></div>
